Overview

This repo contains R scripts and an RMarkdown file used to analyze data on COVID-19 cases recorded since the start of the pandemic in Toronto. It uses data obtained from the Open Data Toronto by the Toronto Public Health organization. The purpose of this report was to assess the ways in which COVID-19 cases are recorded and discuss the skepticism that result from the data painting an incomplete picture of the pandemic. The final report can be viewed here.

More information on the dataset can be found on Open Data Toronto.
